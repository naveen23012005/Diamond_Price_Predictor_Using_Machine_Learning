# 💎 Diamond Price Predictor Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to **predict the price of diamonds** based on their characteristics such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

The model is developed and evaluated inside a Jupyter Notebook using Python and common data science libraries.
